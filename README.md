# Michas
This is my first web project. While doing it, I learned to use technologies such as javaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Git and Github. I also used frameworks such as bootstrap 4 and sweetalert, as well as JQuery as a javaScript library.
It is about a ficticious food e-commerce. You can see the website in https://felipepuiggarimedici.github.io/Michas/
